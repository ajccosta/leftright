# Left-Right Concurrency Control

This is an implementation of left-right concurrency control in C++. The
concurrency control mechanism is by Pedro Ramalhete and Andreia Correia. My
contribution is solely an implementation that makes use of modern C++ features.

As I write this, papers on this concurrency control technique are forthcoming,
for the time being the best reference is probably
http://concurrencyfreaks.blogspot.com/2013/12/left-right-concurrency-control.html

This is a header-only library. Simply put the leftright.hpp file somewhere in
that your C++ compiler can find it and you're good to go.
